Stable Skull Protuberance Approximation Summary
==================================================

APPROACH: Least-squares approximation (NOT interpolation)
This avoids numerical instability of high-degree interpolation.

Y threshold: 50.0 pixels
Total protuberance points: 56

Approximation Results:
  Degree 5: error = 2.016 px
  Degree 10: error = 0.936 px
  Degree 15: error = 0.700 px
  Degree 20: error = 0.459 px
