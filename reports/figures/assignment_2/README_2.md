# Assignment 2: 2D Parametric Spline Curves

This assignment implements parametric spline curves in 2D using quadratic splines.

## Theory

### 2D Parametric Splines

A 2D spline curve is defined parametrically using two splines: x(t) and y(t), where t is a parameter. Each of these splines interpolates the x and y coordinates of a set of points for the same parameter values.

For a set of 2D points (x₁, y₁), (x₂, y₂), ..., (xₙ, yₙ) and corresponding parameter values t₁, t₂, ..., tₙ:

1. The x-coordinate spline x(t) interpolates points (t₁, x₁), (t₂, x₂), ..., (tₙ, xₙ)
2. The y-coordinate spline y(t) interpolates points (t₁, y₁), (t₂, y₂), ..., (tₙ, yₙ)

When evaluated for any parameter value t, the curve returns a point (x(t), y(t)) that lies on the spline curve.

### Quadratic Splines

We use quadratic splines for both x(t) and y(t). A quadratic spline consists of piecewise quadratic polynomials:

For the interval [tᵢ, tᵢ₊₁], the spline is defined as:
- x(t) = aᵢ⋅t² + bᵢ⋅t + cᵢ
- y(t) = aᵢ'⋅t² + bᵢ'⋅t + cᵢ'

Where the coefficients (aᵢ, bᵢ, cᵢ) and (aᵢ', bᵢ', cᵢ') are determined by solving a system of equations that ensures:
1. The spline passes through each given point
2. The first derivatives are continuous at interior points
3. The first spline segment is linear (a₁ = 0 for the first interval)

## Ellipse Example

The first example creates a quadratic spline curve that interpolates five points on an ellipse with semi-major axis a = 4 and semi-minor axis b = 5. The points are generated by:

1. Choosing five random parameter values uᵢ in [0, 2π]
2. Generating points pᵢ = (a⋅cos(uᵢ), b⋅sin(uᵢ))
3. Creating a 2D spline curve that interpolates these points

This example visualizes:
- The original ellipse
- The quadratic spline curve passing through the selected points
- Tangent vectors along the curve

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

### Running the Ellipse Example

```bash
python -m assignment_2.main --example ellipse --show_derivatives
```

### Custom Points Example

You can provide your own set of 2D points:

```bash
python -m assignment_2.main --example custom --points 0,0 1,2 3,1 5,4 --show_derivatives
```

## Implementation Details

The implementation is structured as follows:

1. `QuadraticSpline` class: Implements a 1D quadratic spline for a single coordinate (x or y)
2. `Spline2D` class: Combines two `QuadraticSpline` instances to create a 2D parametric curve
3. Example functions: Demonstrates the use of spline curves with specific examples

### Key Features

- Parameter values can be provided or automatically generated using chord-length parameterization
- Derivatives can be calculated and visualized as tangent vectors
- Ability to interpolate any set of 2D points
